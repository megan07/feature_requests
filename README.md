# feature_requests

Clone the repo, cd to the parent 'feature_requests' directory.

Run <code>python manage.py syncdb</code>

Then run <code>python manage.py runserver</code>

In your browser go to 'localhost:8000'

First, add a client and then submit a request.

From there the navigation should be easy!
